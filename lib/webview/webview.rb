  # A Service is a non-visual component encapsulating the information required to perform
  # some work on one or more background threads. As part of the JavaFX UI library, the
  # Service knows about the JavaFX Application thread and is designed to relieve the
  # application developer from the burden of manging multithreaded code that interacts
  # with the user interface. As such, all of the methods and state on the Service are
  # intended to be invoked exclusively from the JavaFX Application thread.
  #
  # Service implements Worker. As such, you can observe the state of the background
  # operation and optionally cancel it. Service is a reusable Worker, meaning that it can
  # be reset and restarted. Due to this, a Service can be constructed declaratively and
  # restarted on demand.
  # 
  # If an Executor is specified on the Service, then it will be used to actually execute
  # the service. Otherwise, a daemon thread will be created and executed. If you wish to
  # create non-daemon threads, then specify a custom Executor (for example, you could use
  # a ThreadPoolExecutor with a custom ThreadFactory).
  #
  # Because a Service is intended to simplify declarative use cases, subclasses should
  # expose as properties the input parameters to the work to be done. For example,
  # suppose I wanted to write a Service which read the first line from any URL and
  # returned it as a String. Such a Service might be defined, such that it had a single
  # property, url.
  #
  # GuiCommunication establishes a communication channel from the ruby script and the
  # JavaFX Application.
